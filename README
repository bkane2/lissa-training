This directory  is for development of a version of liss5.lisp that constructs
ULFs for user inputs recursively: shallow-match to find top-level phrases,
bracketing the apparent phrases with their rule-tree roots for interpreting
them fully (*yn-question-ulf-tree*, *np-ulf-tree*, *rel-ulf-tree*, etc.)

To run the test, do

(load "init-test.lisp")

The file also shows some sentences for testing.
